# sock's dotfiles (sockfiles...?)
very much a Work In Progress -- however, you gotta start somewhere! :-)
most of this looks bad (so far........)

## what's here so far
- sway (wayland tiling window manager)
- waybar (taskbar/statusbar/whatever its called)
- foot (terminal)

## what's to be added
- no clue :-) we'll see...
